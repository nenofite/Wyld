The player begins stranded\r\nsomewhere inside a sprawling wilderness without another living person\r\nanywhere to be found.  They must use whatever they still have with them\r\nand whatever they can craft from their surroundings to survive in the\r\nharsh wilderness for as long as possible.\r\n\r\nThe game will feature in-depth combat and hunting.  The player and the\r\nanimals will leave tracks in the ground as they walk around, which can\r\nbe followed once the player develops that skill.  However, the player\r\nmust beware, as not-so-friendly wild animals will follow these trails,\r\ntoo.  In addition, all animals leave scent trails which carry on the\r\nwind.  While hunting, the player must take into account their angle\r\nfrom the target to avoid being noticed.  Sounds created by the player\r\nand animals will become a factor of play, as well.  This detailed system\r\nallows the player to use more than just their brute force to stay alive.\r\n\r\nOn top of the intricate combat system, Wyld will feature an immersive AI\r\nfor the animals.  Through this detailed AI system, emergent behaviors\r\ncan occur in the animals.  This emergent behavior allows the player to\r\nuse their wit to evade animals or trap them in a hard situation.\r\nInstead of killing that wolf, why not throw a hunk of meat and sneak\r\nby while its preoccupied?\r\n\r\nWyld aims to be a very immersive game with detailed and intuitive game\r\nmechanics, while keeping the player on their toes as they linger on the\r\nedge of death.\r\n\r\n# How to Get It\r\n\r\nWyld is still *very* early on in development and missing several major\r\nfeatures.  Once it reaches a more useable state, binaries will be\r\navailable for download.  Until then, you will have to **compile it\r\nyourself.**\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\n\r\nBefore you compile this, you will need:\r\n\r\n* A D compiler (either `gdc` or `ldc2` is recommended)\r\n* Development packages for ncurses (on Ubuntu: `libncurses5-dev`)\r\n\r\n## Compiling\r\n\r\nTo compile with `gdc`:\r\n\r\n    cd Wyld\r\n    ./build-gdc\r\n    \r\nTo compile with `ldc2`:\r\n\r\n    cd Wyld\r\n    ./build-ldc2\r\n\r\n## Running\r\n\r\nTo run the game:\r\n\r\n    cd Wyld\r\n    ./main\r\n"}
