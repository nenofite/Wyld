# Wyld Combat Prototype

This is a protype for developing Wyld's combat system.  Its codebase is
completely independent of Wyld's.

Combat Prototype uses a very simple text-based interface (similar to a
MUD) in order to keep focus on the combat itself by saving time on
working on the interface.

**Do not use Combat Prototype if you are looking for the full game.  It
is not Wyld.**
