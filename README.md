# What Is It?

Wyld is a wilderness survival roguelike.  The player begins stranded
somewhere inside a sprawling wilderness without another living person
anywhere to be found.  They must use whatever they still have with them
and whatever they can craft from their surroundings to survive in the
harsh wilderness for as long as possible.

The game will feature in-depth combat and hunting.  The player and the
animals will leave tracks in the ground as they walk around, which can
be followed once the player develops that skill.  However, the player
must beware, as not-so-friendly wild animals will follow these trails,
too.  In addition, all animals leave scent trails which carry on the
wind.  While hunting, the player must take into account their angle
from the target to avoid being noticed.  Sounds created by the player
and animals will become a factor of play, as well.  This detailed system
allows the player to use more than just their brute force to stay alive.

On top of the intricate combat system, Wyld will feature an immersive AI
for the animals.  Through this detailed AI system, emergent behaviors
can occur in the animals.  This emergent behavior allows the player to
use their wit to evade animals or trap them in a hard situation.
Instead of killing that wolf, why not throw a hunk of meat and sneak
by while its preoccupied?

Wyld aims to be a very immersive game with detailed and intuitive game
mechanics, while keeping the player on their toes as they linger on the
edge of death.

# How to Get It

Wyld is still *very* early on in development and missing several major
features.  Once it reaches a more useable state, binaries will be
available for download.  Until then, you will have to **compile it
yourself.**

## Requirements

Before you compile this, you will need:

* A D compiler (`gdc` is recommended)
* Development packages for ncurses (on Ubuntu: `libncurses5-dev`)

## Compiling

To compile:

    cd Wyld
    ./build

## Running

To run the game:

    cd Wyld
    ./main
